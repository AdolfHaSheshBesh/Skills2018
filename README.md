# Skills 2018

This is a repository made for all the code related to the Skills competition on 18.12.2018.

## Guidelines

Make sure you do the following:

### 1. The language we'll use is Python

If you don't know Python yet go check [this course](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Hello%2C_World%21), it's very tourough and teaches all the basics needded for any project with Python. 
As for now we have no idea whether the API will use Python 2 or 3 so we'll leave that for later. 
If we can choose either one we will use Python 3.

### 2. Make an issue and PR for everything

In order to prevent errors and merging conflicts we should make an issue and PR for everything.
If we are adding a new feature we should make a PR that includes it. 
In order to merge a PR, we need all the members of the group to approve it.

### 3. Give meaningful names

I'm not trying to be Menny or anything and make you state what does each variable does but it's easier to understand what variable "points" does over variable "x".
It's the same with branches, branch "add-bakum-ahori" is easier to understand than branch "feature-23".

### 4. Delete the branch once it's merged

There's no need to overload the repo with branches, delete them once you're them with them.
